;Write a program approximating of the square root calculation for any positive real number xwith a given precision M.
;When implementing the algorithm, do not use the syntax form set!
;a)set the initial value of the square root  ri=1b)
;if the approximation is reached, i.e. |ri2-x|<M then finish the calculation and returnthe obtained square root,
;otherwise go to step c)c)correct the square root approximationri+1=ri+xri2and go back to step b)
